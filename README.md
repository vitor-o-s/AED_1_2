# Data Structure and Algorithms
Repository to save codes that I made during my Computer Engineer graduate 


This code were made based on [Paulo Feofiloff site](https://www.ime.usp.br/~pf/) and my own others references as a Computer Engineer and Data Scientist student.

# Getting Started
You'll need an IDE or a compiler. I tried not use ADT (abstract data type) to maintain the execution simple, but if preferer you can use.
